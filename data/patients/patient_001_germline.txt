PATIENT: PT-2024-001 (SYNTHETIC - NOT REAL)
DOCUMENT TYPE: Germline Genetic Testing Report
DATE: 2024-03-20
LAB: Genetics Laboratory (Synthetic)
TEST: Comprehensive Hereditary Breast and
      Ovarian Cancer Panel (BRCA1, BRCA2,
      PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, CDH1, PTEN, STK11)

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Breast cancer diagnosis age 52.
Family history: mother breast cancer age 58,
maternal aunt ovarian cancer age 63.

RESULTS:

BRCA1: PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED
Variant: c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs*74)
Classification: Pathogenic
Inheritance: Autosomal Dominant
Clinical Significance: HIGH RISK
Associated cancers: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic

BRCA2: NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED

PALB2: NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED
ATM: NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED
CHEK2: NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED
CDH1: NO PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED

INTERPRETATION:
A pathogenic variant in BRCA1 has been identified.
This finding is consistent with Hereditary Breast
and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) Syndrome.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Genetic counseling for patient and family members
2. Enhanced surveillance protocol
3. Risk reducing surgery discussion (contralateral
   prophylactic mastectomy, risk reducing
   salpingo-oophorectomy)
4. First degree relatives should consider testing
5. PARP inhibitor therapy may be relevant given
   BRCA1 status
